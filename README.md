Responsive design is the way to adapt a website's layout for different screen resolutions using fluid grids that ebb and flow with a device's screen size.

Mobile First, means you're designing an online experience for mobile before designing it for the desktop or for any other device. This is both a strategy and sometimes even a new way of writing code. A few years ago, a desktop site with some adjustments was what you would see on your phone. Now a site is often created specifically with your mobile device in mind. Planning for your site layout is different for mobile than it is for a desktop, because you're forcing yourself to identify what's important about your content to your user. By starting with content, you're able to figure out what is relevant to your users, whether they're using their phone or desktop. . Designing mobile first makes you really think about specific design decisions, like fonts, right at the get-go. If you want the different versions of your site to resemble each other, you'll have to pick a font for your headers that looks great on the smallest device. It would make no sense to use a really beautiful script font if you can't read it on a small screen.
